= Testing your components and applications

You can ensure that your applications are stable, secure, compliant, and mutually compatible by implementing tests for {ProductName} to run on their components. There are currently 3 types of tests in {ProductName}:

* Build-time tests
* Custom tests
* Integration tests

The following sections explain each of these test types in greater detail.

== Build-time tests

Build-time tests in {ProductName} ensure the stability and security of the application, its components, its build pipeline, and the environment in which it is being tested. 

The build-time tests used in {ProductName} are executed in the form of Tekton xref:glossary/index.adoc#task[tasks]. The utility used for validating container information is link:https://www.conftest.dev/[conftest]. A full listing of {ProductName} surface-level tests is available in this document: xref:./build/index.adoc[Build-time tests].

Build-time tests include the following security-focused tests:

* Vulnerability scanning via Clair
* Anti-virus scanning via ClamAV
* Code scanning via SAST tools
+
** You can enable the Snyk test by following xref:./build/snyk.adoc[these instructions].

You can also create your own build-time tests. To add a custom build-time test for a component, xref:/how-tos/configuring/customizing-the-build.adoc[customize its build pipeline] to include the test as another Tekton task. 

== Integration tests

Integration tests ensure that all components within an application are able to work together at the same time. You can xref:./integration/adding.adoc[add an integration test], simply by giving {ProductName} the address to a GitHub repo, and the path within that repo to an IntegrationTestScenario (ITS). An ITS is a YAML file, one that contains a Tekton Pipeline that defines an integration test.

{ProductName} runs integration tests after it successfully builds the various components of an application. As part of the build process, {ProductName} creates an image for each component and stores them in a repository. Images of all the components are then compiled into a snapshot of the application. {ProductName} tests the snapshot against user-defined IntegrationTestScenarios, which, again, is a YAML file in a GitHub repository. 

As with build-time tests, you can also create your own integration tests.  To add your own test that runs on all components of an application, xref:./integration/creating.adoc[create a custom integration test].
